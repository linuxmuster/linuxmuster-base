linuxmuster-base (0.3-1) testing; urgency=low

  * renamed config-templates & config-tasks to config-static & config-dynamic
  * added static and dynamic config templates for apache2 enabling pam authentification
    for use with htaccess files
  * fixed *.target not found error in linuxmuster-setup if there is no target file
    in config-dynamic subdirectory
  * added create-ssl-cert.sh script to /usr/sbin to create the server side selfsigned
    ssl certificates during setup.
    certificates are used by apache2, cyrus21 and postfix.
  * added debconf templates for ssl cert data: country, state, location & schoolname.
  * added static config-template for /etc/moodle/apache.conf
  * added .htaccess to /usr/share/moodle to let only admin access the pages since
    moodle is unconfigured
  * added code to set mysql root password in /usr/lib/linuxmuster/bin/linuxmuster-patch.sh
  * added static & dynamic config-templates for cyrus21, moodle, mysql, horde2,imp3,
    kronolith, mnemo, nag, sork, turba
  * added configuration for clamav & amavisd-new
  * added postfix-tls
  * modified postfix configuration to work with cyrus & amavisd-new
  * changed parameters for linuxmuster-setup:
    --first     : does a first time installation with tasksel tasks, asks questions,
                  stores answers in debconf database and overwrites static and dynamic
                  configuration files with values stored in debconf database
    --askme     : asks questions, stores answers in debconf database and overwrites
                  dynamic configuration files with values stored in debconf database
    --dontaskme : overwrites dynamic configuration files with values stored in debconf
                  database without any question (attention!)
    Without any parameter linuxmuster-setup will do nothing at all.
    Patching will now be done in linuxmuster-patch.sh.
  * added script /usr/lib/linuxmuster/bin/add-cyrus-user.pl
    usage: add-cyrus-user.pl -u user [options]
    options: -q quota (in kb)
             -part partition (default="default")
    To create users within cyrus you need the cyrus password which is the same as the
    admin password. The script gets the admin password out of the debconf database.
  * added a patched version of sophomorix-add which calls add-cyrus-user.pl on user
    creation.
  * added /usr/lib/linuxmuster/bin/patch_fstab.pl to patch /etc/fstab as d-i/late_command
    (see /cdrom/cfg/auto and /cdrom/cfg/expert) with quota mount options for /home and
    noatime option for /var.
